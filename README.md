- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
## Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation
This project has one html file (index.html), one script file (script.js) and one css files (style.css).

To get the current weather and 5-day forecast of another city enter the name into the search field and either press Enter or click the Search button. If the city is found the current weather and 5-day forcast will be shown. Then the name of that city will appear at the top of the recent city list. The list will be updated in local storage. 

If the city name is not recognized,
